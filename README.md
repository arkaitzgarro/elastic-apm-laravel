# Elastic APM

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/arkaitzgarro/elastic-apm-laravel.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/arkaitzgarro/elastic-apm-laravel)

Elastic APM agent for v2 intake API. Compatible with Laravel 5.5+.

## Installation

Require this package with composer:

    composer require arkaitzgarro/elastic-apm-laravel

Add the ServiceProvider class to the providers array in `config/app.php`:

```php
'providers' => [
    // ... more providers
    \AG\ElasticApmLaravel\ServiceProvider::class,
],
```

From here, we will take care of everything based on your configuration. The agent and the middleware will be registered, and transactions will be sent to Elastic.

To get an additional recorded span, you may include the provided job middleware (Laravel 6+ only https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/queues#job-middleware):

```php
public function middleware()
{
    return [
        app(\AG\ElasticApmLaravel\Jobs\Middleware\RecordTransaction::class),
    ];
}
```

## Agent configuration

The following environment variables are supported in the default configuration:

| Variable          | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
|APM_ACTIVE         | `true` or `false` defaults to `true`. If `false`, the agent will collect, but not send, transaction data. |
|APM_APPNAME        | Name of the app as it will appear in APM. Invalid special characters will be replaced with a hyphen. |
|APM_APPVERSION     | Version of the app as it will appear in APM. |
|APM_SERVERURL      | URL to the APM intake service. |
|APM_SECRETTOKEN    | Secret token, if required. |
|APM_USEROUTEURI    | `true` or `false` defaults to `true`. The default behavior is to record the URL as defined in your routes configuration. Set to `false` to record the requested URL, but keep in mind that this can result in excessive unique entries in APM. |
|APM_QUERYLOG       | `true` or `false` defaults to 'true'. Set to `false` to completely disable query logging, or to `auto` if you would like to use the threshold feature. |
|APM_THRESHOLD      | Query threshold in milliseconds, defaults to `200`. If a query takes longer then 200ms, we enable the query log. Make sure you set `APM_QUERYLOG=auto`. |
|APM_BACKTRACEDEPTH | Defaults to `25`. Depth of backtrace in query span. |
|APM_MAXTRACEITEMS  | Defaults to `1000`. Max number of child items displayed when viewing trace details. |

You may also publish the `elastic-apm-laravel.php` configuration file to change additional settings:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=config
```

Once published, open the `config/elastic-apm-laravel.php` file and review the various settings.

## Manual span tracking

Requests, jobs, and queries are handled automatically, but if you'd like to record additional spans throughout your app, you can do so via the `ApmCollector` facade. If APM_ACTIVE is not set, these measurements will be gracefully ignored. Usage:

```php
use AG\ElasticApmLaravel\Facades\ApmCollector;

ApmCollector::startMeasure('my-custom-span', 'custom', 'measure', 'My custom span');

// do something amazing

ApmCollector::stopMeasure('my-custom-span');
```
